A bright, intense light shines from above—a prismatic entity floating in the sky, its rays casting pure white beams across the valley. You feel an intense pressure build up, and before you can even react, the light envelops you. When the light fades, you realize with a mix of awe and terror that you’ve grown to an enormous size—hundreds of kilometers tall. The land beneath you is now a vast expanse, with tiny structures and people barely visible at your feet.",
